        <h2>Countertop care and maintenance</h2>
        <p><strong>Granite, Marble</strong></p>
        <p>Granite countertop care and maintenance comes down to just a few simple steps that will keep your granite countertops looking like new for years. Polished granite will not lose its shine and will not scratch from normal wear.</p>
        <p>Granite is extremely hard but like any natural stone, it is slightly porous. Anything acidic can etch the glossy surface and oils can soak into an unsealed top, so it’s important to quickly clean up spills like wine, oil, mustard, citrus or chemicals before they can soak into the surface or damage the gloss. Although water left to puddle on the surface of the granite will leave a dark stain, this will disappear when it dries out completely. To be safe, seal granite countertops to reduce absorption of oils and liquids that may stain the granite.</p>
        <p><i>Cleaning Countertops</i></p>
        <p>We suggest simply use warm water and mild, phosphate-free, biodegradable liquid dish soap, preferably light-colored and containing no aromatics. This is a gentle way to clean the grease and grime from your granite counters without damaging them. If you use plain soap and water, this can lead to soap build up and over time, will dull the glossy finish of your polished granite. Never use powdered cleansers to clean your stone as they contain pumice which is an abrasive. Never use acidic cleaners that may include ammonia.</p>
        <p><strong>Quartz</strong></p>
        <p>Quartz surfaces are heat- and scratch-resistant, but not heat- and scratch-proof. Use trivets or pads with hot pots, and always use a cutting board. Never chop or slice food directly on your countertops.</p>
        <p><i>How to clean</i></p>
        <p>Quartz requires a simple routine care to maintain. Cleaning with a damp cloth and a liquid detergent will do the job. Because quartz is impervious to stains, it will withstand daily exposure. Just wipe away and the surface is like new again. Adhered materials like food can be scraped away with a plastic putty knife; any marks left by the blade can be removed with Soft Scrub Liquid Gel.</p>
        <p>Any multi-purpose cleaner or detergent with a neutral pH can be used on stains. If it still persists, use a non-abrasive scouring pad to shift the dirt. It won’t damage the tough surface. Cleaning liquids like KleenWarrior® are also good for removing stains that seem to be hard to remove at first.</p>
